In this Case Study, I showcased my Python Data Analysis skills by investigating the implications of pump failure for the Southern Water Corporation:

* Create Line Plots and Box Plots
* Understand Descriptive Statistics from the .describe() functions
* Detect and Remove Outliers from your Dataset
* Subset and Filter your DataFrames
* Use For Loops to smartly loop through data
* Use Dual Axes to Plot Multiple Variables on different axes
* Interpret Correlation Coefficients and Heatmaps
* Create and assess the goodness of fit for your Linear Regression Models

Part I of the Case Study: Descriptive Statistics 
Part II of the Case Study: Inferential Statistical Analysis
